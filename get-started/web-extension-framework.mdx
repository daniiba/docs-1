If your extension is built using the [WXT framework](https://wxt.dev/), you can easily integrate Mellowtel into it.
You can see how to do it by following the guide on [Github](https://github.com/yacine-bens/mellowtel-wxt-samples).

If you have any questions or need further assistance, please contact at [yacine.web.ext@gmail.com](mailto:yacine.web.ext@gmail.com) or join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/txAZp4MSDe).
