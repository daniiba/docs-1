You will learn how to install the npm package and how to use it in your project.

Note: Mellowtel is designed for Manifest V3 Chrome Extension only. For now, it is necessary to organize your code in a compiled way, by using Webpack, Rollup, or other bundlers.

# Install npm package

To install the npm package, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```npm
npm install mellowtel
```

# Set up your Manifest
Mellowtel requires some permissions to work properly (`storage`, `tabs`, `declarativeNetRequest`).

Depending on which permissions you have already requested and which you haven't, there are two ways to proceed with the integration.

### Option 1

If, when installing your extension, an alert window pops up asking for permission to `Read and change all your data on all websites`, you can simply update your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "storage",
    "tabs",
    "declarativeNetRequest"
  ]
}
```

### Option 2

If the alert window doesn't pop up, or asks for permissions only on specific websites, you need to add `tabs` and `declarativeNetRequest` to your `optional_permissions`.
Mellowtel will automatically request these permissions if the user decides to opt in.
If it's not already there, you also need to add the `storage` permission. This can be done in the `permissions` section as it doesn't display an alert window.

```json
{
  "optional_permissions": [
    "tabs",
    "declarativeNetRequest"
  ],
  "permissions": [
    "storage"
  ]
}
```

### Web Store Justification

The Web Store requires you to justify the permissions you are requesting. Here is a template you can use (it explains how Mellowtel uses the permissions):

**Tabs**:
```txt
The tabs permission is required to access the URL of the current page in the service worker. It also facilitates messaging between the contentScript and the service worker.
```

**DeclarativeNetRequest**:
```txt
The declarativeNetRequest permission is required to strip certain headers (e.g. X-Frame headers) from some responses on the sub_frame level. This allows displaying websites in an iframe without running into issues related to cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). These headers are immediately restored after the response is processed.
```

# Set up your background script
In your `background.js` file, you need to import the `mellowtel` package.

```javascript
import Mellowtel from "mellowtel";
```

You can then use `Mellowtel(configuration_key, options?)` to create a new instance of the Mellowtel object. The Mellowtel object is your entrypoint to the rest of Mellowtel's SDK. Your `configuration_key` is required when calling this function, as it identifies your extension to Mellowtel. You can find your `configuration_key` in the dashboard.

```javascript
const mellowtel = new Mellowtel("<configuration_key>");
```

Initialize Mellowtel by calling the `initBackground` method. This method will initialize the Mellowtel object and set up the necessary listeners.

```javascript
await mellowtel.initBackground();
```

Only for the first time, you will need to show a disclaimer/message to the end-user. You can do so in a web page or in a popup (even at a later point). The methods
`getOptInStatus()`, `optIn()`, `optOut()` and `start()` are accessible from any part of your extension, so you can call them from a popup, a content script, or a background script.

To check if the user has already opted in, you can call the `getOptInStatus` method, which is a promise that resolves to a boolean value.

```javascript
const hasOptedIn = await mellowtel.getOptInStatus();
```

Once the user has read the disclaimer and agreed to join the network, call these methods:

```javascript
await mellowtel.optIn()
await mellowtel.start()
```

If the user decides to opt out, you can call the `optOut` method. Mellowtel won't activate for this user anymore until the user opts in again.

```javascript
await mellowtel.optOut()
```

# Set up your content script
You have to import the `mellowtel` package in your content script as well.

```javascript
import Mellowtel from "mellowtel";
```

Again, you can use `Mellowtel(configuration_key, options?)` to create a new instance of the Mellowtel object.

```javascript
const mellowtel = new Mellowtel("<configuration_key>");
```

Initialize Mellowtel by calling the `initContentScript()` method. This method will initialize the Mellowtel object and set up the necessary listeners.

```javascript
await mellowtel.initContentScript();
```

This content script should run in `all_frames` and `<all_urls>` at the `document_start`, so you need to add the following to your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "content_scripts": [
    {
      "matches": ["<all_urls>"],
      "js": ["content.js"],
      "run_at": "document_start",
      "all_frames": true
    }
  ]
}
```

If, for some reason, you can't have your content script running with these settings, just create a new content script that runs with these settings and import the `mellowtel` package in it.
