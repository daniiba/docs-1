Mellowtel allows you to monetize your Chrome Extensions.

Through the Open-Source library, your users can share a fraction of their unused internet by using a transparent opt-in/out mechanism. Trusted partners â€” from startups to enterprises â€” access the internet through the network to scrape publicly available websites and you get a share of the revenue (1000 users â€”> $50 MRR)


This is the Mellowtel documentation. It's a great place to find most answers. If you have other questions, need help or want to be part of our community please join us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/txAZp4MSDe).
