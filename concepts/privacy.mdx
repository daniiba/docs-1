## Introduction
Every user in the network is assigned a random identifier not linked to any personal information. This ensures total anonymity.

Every request gets loaded in a [credentialless iframe](https://github.com/mellowtel-inc/mellowtel-js/blob/69f979132207cd59cd8d50e629ea3f26211fc3d7/src/utils/iframe-helpers.ts#L16), so no personal information is shared with the network (no cookies, local storage, session storage, etc).

You can read more about how credentialless iframe works by reading the mdn web docs [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/IFrame_credentialless)
