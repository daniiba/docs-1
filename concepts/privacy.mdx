## Introduction
Every user in the network is assigned a random identifier not linked to any personal information. This ensures total anonymity.

Every request gets loaded in a credentialless iframe, so no personal information is shared with the network (no cookies, local storage, session storage, etc).

You can read more about the credentialless iframe [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/IFrame_credentialless)
