## Introduction
Every user in the network is assigned a random identifier not linked to any personal information. This ensures total anonymity.

Every request gets loaded in a credentialless iframe. You can look at the implementation as it's open-source on [Github](https://github.com/mellowtel-inc/mellowtel-js/blob/69f979132207cd59cd8d50e629ea3f26211fc3d7/src/utils/iframe-helpers.ts#L16), so no personal information is shared with the network (no cookies, local storage, session storage, etc).
Basically it's like the requests are being handled in an incognito tab that is not linked to the user's browser.

You can read more about how credentialless iframe works by reading the mdn web docs [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/IFrame_credentialless)
