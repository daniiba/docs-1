## Introduction

In order to activate Mellowtel users must give their explicit consent. The library provides a way to opt in or opt out.
The core idea is that since it's their unused Internet bandwidth, they should decide if they want to share it or not.

This is why on the first installation/update with Mellowtel imported you must show a disclaimer/consent dialog that is not dismissible.
Moreover, there must always be a clear way for users to change the settings at their convenience.

</Frame>


You can implement the opt-in/opt-out logic in two ways:

1) Using the recommended implementation with the pre-built page provided by Mellowtel. You can simply call the `generateAndOpenOptInLink()` method.

2) Creating your own opt-in/opt-out elements. If users agree you can activate them on the Network by calling the `optIn()` method. If they don't agree, you call the `optOut()` method.


## 1) Recommended implementation

When you import Mellowtel, we recommend opening a [pre built page](https://www.mellow.tel/opt-in/?extension_id=clahhkgkchmgcfmcgaldgicnhnlnfdkf&configuration_key=54584498&debug_mode=true) so users can see the disclaimer and decide if they want to opt in or out.
This also ensures that you can maximize the number of users that opt in, as they can see the benefits of the Mellowtel Network. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
import Mellowtel from "mellowtel";

let mellowtel;

(async () => {
    mellowtel = new Mellowtel("54584498")
    await mellowtel.initBackground();
})();

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(async function(details) {
    console.log("Extension Installed or Updated");
    // If you want to handle first install and updates differently
    /**
    if(details.reason === "install"){
        // call a function to handle a first install
    } else if(details.reason === "update") {
        // call a function to handle an update
    }
    **/
    await mellowtel.generateAndOpenOptInLink();
});
```

## 2) Custom elements
If you want you can create your own custom opt-in/opt-out elements and handle user's choice by using the `optIn()` and `optOut()` method.

## Example of a text to use for the update

When you update your extension, you can inform your users about the Mellowtel library and ask them to opt in.
Here is a text you could use for the update:

```markdown
Hi ðŸ‘‹,

Happy to announce an update that will help maintain this extension free and available to everybody...but it requires an action from you!

This new version includes the open-source [Mellowtel](https://www.mellowtel.it/mellowtel-user-guide/) library. If you opt-in, this library will let you share your unused internet with trusted AI labs & startups who use it to train their models.

As the developer of this extension, I get a small share of the revenue.

By opting in now, other than helping maintain this extension free and available, you will be eligible to be in the beta version and start earning for your unused internet too. In case you change your mind, you can opt out at any time from [INSERT OPTION HERE]

Mellowtel shares your bandwidth only. Security and privacy are 100% guaranteed and the library is open source for everyone to see.

It doesn't collect, share, or sell personal information (not even anonymized data). Itâ€™s also highly regulated: Mellowtel keeps communicating with Chrome Web Store regulators to guarantee a safe experience and enforce compliance.

Thanks!
```
