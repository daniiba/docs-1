## Introduction

Mellowtel doesn't activate any user on the network without their explicit consent. This is why the library provides a way to opt in or out.

On the first installation/update with Mellowtel imported, you must ask the user if they want to opt-in in the Network and share their unused Internet bandwidth. You can do so by showing a disclaimer/consent dialog that is not dismissible.
Moreover there must always be a clear way for users to change the settings at their convenience and opt-out/opt-in at any time.

> If you click on 'Accept all', we will use the Mellowtel API to:
Use your unused bandwidth to enable trusted partners to access internet resources by also routing part of their traffic through your node in the network.
If you choose "Decline optional use", we will not use the additional purposes indicated.
The service is used by trusted partners without affecting the speed or quality of your browsing. You can choose not to participate at any time from this page. By accepting full use, you help us keep the service free and available.

If they agree, you can activate them on the Network by calling the `optIn()` method. If they don't agree, you can call the `optOut()` method, and they won't be activated.


## Recommended implementation

When you import Mellowtel, we recommend opening a [pre-built page] (https://www.mellow.tel/opt-in/?extension_id=clahhkgkchmgcfmcgaldgicnhnlnfdkf&configuration_key=54584498&debug_mode=true) so the user can see the disclaimer and decide if they want to opt in or out.
This also ensures that you can maximize the number of users that opt in, as they can see the benefits of the Mellowtel Network. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
import Mellowtel from "mellowtel";

let mellowtel;

(async () => {
    mellowtel = new Mellowtel("54584498")
    await mellowtel.initBackground();
})();

chrome.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(async function(details) {
    console.log("Extension Installed or Updated");
    // If you want to handle first install and updates differently
    /**
    if(details.reason === "install"){
        // call a function to handle a first install
    } else if(details.reason === "update") {
        // call a function to handle an update
    }
    **/
    await mellowtel.generateAndOpenOptInLink();
});
```

Here is a text you can use for the update:

```markdown
Hi ðŸ‘‹,

Happy to announce an update that will help maintain this extension free and available to everybody...but it requires action from you!

This new version includes the open-source [Mellowtel](https://www.mellowtel.it/mellowtel-user-guide/) library. If you opt-in, this library will let you share your unused internet with trusted AI labs & startups who use it to train their models.

As the developer of this extension, I get a small share of the revenue.

By opting in now, other than helping maintain this extension free and available, you will be eligible to be in the beta version and start earning for your unused internet too. In case you change your mind, you can opt out at any time from [INSERT OPTION HERE]

Mellowtel shares your bandwidth only. Security and privacy are 100% guaranteed and the library is open source for everyone to see.

It doesn't collect, share, or sell personal information (not even anonymized data). Itâ€™s also highly regulated: Mellowtel keeps communicating with Chrome Web Store regulators to guarantee a safe experience. It also provides CWS regulators with tools to monitor and enforce compliance.

Thanks!
```
